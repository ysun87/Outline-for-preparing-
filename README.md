#Basement for a data scientist

To be a good data scientist, three basement should be solid: statistic, linear algebra and python/SQL(programming). 
For the upper level like machine learning, deepp learning, etc, all of them are built on them. <br>

Statistics <br>
There are mainly four parts of problems which will block students have a better understanding of statistics. <br>
(1) concept <br>

(2) computational skills <br>
(3) Explains things <br>
(4) From the overall to get into detail <br>

Linear Algebra <br>

Python  <br>
Learning it from projects <br>
